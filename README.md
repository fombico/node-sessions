A sample node app that demonstrates sessions.

#### Setup
```
npm install
node server
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser and you should see a count of the number of times the a request has been made by a user.
Refreshing the page increases the count. Opening an incognito window or a different browser, will show a different number as it is a different session.
